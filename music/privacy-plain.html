                <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-brand-chestnut mb-4">4. Privacy-First Approach</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    LizMusic is designed with privacy as a core principle:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your music data, playback history, and preferences are stored locally on your device</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Analytics:</strong> We collect only anonymous usage data and crash reports via Firebase to improve app quality. We do not track your specific music listening content or build detailed user profiles</li>
                    <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You can use LizMusic without creating an account or providing personal information</li>
                    <li><strong>Encrypted Credentials:</strong> Cloud storage credentials are encrypted and stored only on your device</li>
                    <li><strong>No Data Selling:</strong> We will never sell your personal data to third parties</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Permissions:</strong> We only request permissions that are essential for specific features you choose to use</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent Tracking:</strong> All data collection is disclosed in this policy, and most analytics features help us fix bugs and crashes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-brand-chestnut mb-4">5. Cloud Storage Integration</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    <strong>User-Provided Cloud Storage:</strong> LizMusic does NOT provide cloud storage services. To use cloud sync features,
                    you must have your own accounts with third-party providers (WebDAV servers, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) that YOU
                    set up and pay for independently.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    When you connect your personal cloud storage accounts, your music files are synced directly between YOUR device
                    and YOUR cloud provider. LizMusic does NOT store, access, or process your music files on our servers.
                    We only store the encrypted connection credentials locally on your device.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    Your cloud provider's privacy policy applies to any data stored in your cloud accounts. You are responsible for:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 mb-3">
                    <li>Signing up for and paying for cloud storage subscriptions</li>

                    <li>Ensuring you have legal rights to all content in your cloud storage</li>
                    <li>Complying with your cloud provider's terms and privacy policies</li>

                <p class="leading-relaxed font-semibold text-brand-chestnut">
                    LizMusic has no access to, control over, or responsibility for the content in your cloud storage accounts.
