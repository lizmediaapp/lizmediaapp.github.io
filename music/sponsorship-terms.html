            <p><strong>Version 1.1.0 - Updated Benefits Policy</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning">
            <h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE - Please Read Carefully</h3>
            <p>Our sponsorship program operates differently from traditional subscriptions. Once you cancel your sponsorship, you CANNOT become a sponsor again, and you will lose your ad-free experience. This is a permanent restriction. Please consider this carefully before making your decision.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Sponsorship Program Overview</h2>
        <p>LizMusic offers a unique sponsorship program that allows users to support the development and maintenance of the app while receiving premium features and benefits. This is NOT a traditional subscription service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Support ongoing development and keep LizMusic free and ad-free</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Recurring monthly or yearly sponsorship</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Ad-free experience during active sponsorship period and premium app features</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> Sponsorship does NOT include music content - you must provide your own music files</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. One-Time Sponsorship Policy</h2>
        <div class="critical">
            <p>⚠️ CRITICAL RESTRICTION:</p>
            <p>Once you cancel your sponsorship, you are permanently ineligible to become a sponsor again. Additionally, you will lose your ad-free experience when your sponsorship expires. This restriction applies to your Google account and cannot be reversed by customer support, technical support, or any other means.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Why this policy exists:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintains the integrity and exclusivity of our sponsorship program</li>
            <li>Ensures fairness to committed long-term sponsors</li>
            <li>Prevents exploitation of the permanent ad-free benefit</li>
            <li>Supports sustainable development funding model</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Ad-Free Benefits During Sponsorship</h2>
        <div class="benefit">
            <h3>🎆 ACTIVE SPONSORSHIP BENEFIT:</h3>
            <p>While you are an active sponsor, you enjoy a completely ad-free experience in LizMusic. This applies to all current and future advertisements that may be added to the app.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>What "active sponsorship" means:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ad-free experience while your sponsorship is active and paid</li>
            <li>Protection from any advertisements during your sponsorship period</li>
            <li>Enhanced app features and priority support</li>
            <li>Tied to your Google account - works across your devices</li>
            <li>Can be restored on new devices using "Restore Purchases"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="critical">
            <p>⚠️ IMPORTANT - Loss of Benefits:</p>
            <p>When you cancel your sponsorship, you will lose your ad-free experience at the end of your current billing period. You may see advertisements in the app after your sponsorship expires.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Billing and Renewal</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1 Automatic Renewal:</strong> Your sponsorship will automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or yearly) unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Payment Processing:</strong> All payments are processed securely through Google Play Store. LizMusic does not store or process your payment information.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Price Protection:</strong> Your sponsorship rate is locked for your current billing cycle. Price changes (if any) only apply to new sponsors or at your next renewal.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4 Billing Currency:</strong> Charges will appear in your local currency as determined by Google Play Store based on your account location.</p>

        <h2>5. Cancellation Process</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1 How to Cancel:</strong> Cancel through your Google Play account settings > Subscriptions > LizMusic Sponsorship. You cannot cancel directly through the LizMusic app.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Timing:</strong> You must cancel at least 24 hours before your next billing date to avoid being charged for the next period.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Final Warning:</strong> Google Play will show you a final confirmation before cancellation. Remember: once cancelled, you cannot sponsor again.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4 After Cancellation:</strong> You keep all benefits (including ad-free access) until the end of your paid period. After that, you will lose ad-free access and cannot sponsor again.</p>

        <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1 Google Play Policy:</strong> All refund requests are handled by Google Play Store according to their refund policy. LizMusic cannot directly process refunds.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2 Limited Refund Eligibility:</strong> Due to the permanent benefits provided (especially permanent ad-free access), refunds may be limited or unavailable after you've received the benefits.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3 Refund Process:</strong> Contact Google Play support directly for refund requests. Include your order number and reason for the refund request.</p>
